  Have you ever wondered what the second most famous person in Iceland (after
  Björk) does for fun? We’re talking about Jónsi, the frontman of Icelandic
  avant-noise band Sigur Rós. The answer? Jónsi makes perfume. The musician
  began experimenting with essential oils and aroma-chemicals eight years ago.
  Today, two of his signature perfumes can be purchased from a store operated by
  his sisters in Reykjavík
