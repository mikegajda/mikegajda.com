excerpt: >-
  The open secret of Ms. Warrenâ€™s campaign is that her big-money fund-raising
  through 2018 helped lay the foundation for her anti-big-money run for the
  presidency. Last winter and spring, she transferred $10.4 million in leftover
  funds from her 2018 Senate campaign to underwrite her 2020 run, a portion of
  which was raised from the same donor class she is now running against.
