excerpt: >-
  I’d read these numbers as a sign that tipping is likely becoming standard in
  ride-share services in the United States, and, with plenty of stories out on
  how Uber and other car-service drivers struggle to make a living, the right
  thing to do. But counter-service tipping is still a judgment call, and perhaps
  should be based on the service you receive, your own budget, your status as a
  regular and perhaps your knowledge of workers’ salaries overall or at the
  particular establishment you’re frequenting.
