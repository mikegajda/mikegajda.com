excerpt: >-
  Kenshō, launching today, is an invite-only subscription-based platform for
  holistic healthcare providers to list their services and share knowledge. The
  startup has also collected information to construct a research-backed guide to
  holistic health, something the team believes has been missing from the natural
  health sector.
