excerpt: >-
  Today’s small children, aka Generation Alpha, are the first to grow up with
  robots as peers. Those winsome talking devices spawned by a booming
  education-tech industry can speed children’s learning, but they also can be
  confusing to them, research shows. Many children think robots are smarter than
  humans or imbue them with magical powers.


  The long-term consequences of growing up surrounded by AI-driven devices won’t
  be clear for a while. But an expanding body of research is lending new impetus
  to efforts to expand technology education beyond learning to code, to
  understanding how AI works. Children need help drawing boundaries between
  themselves and the technology, and gaining confidence in their own ability to
  control and master it, researchers say.
