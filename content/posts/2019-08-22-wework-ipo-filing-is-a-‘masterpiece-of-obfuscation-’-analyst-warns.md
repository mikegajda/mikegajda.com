excerpt: >-
  Triton sees high levels of obfuscation in WeWork’s prospectus, filed last
  week. For example, the company stops counting sales and marketing expenses at
  a given location once the location has been open for two years — but the
  spending doesn’t actually stop after that. Instead, it counts as an operating
  expense, Triton said.
