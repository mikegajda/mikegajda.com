excerpt: >-
  "Chris Christie, the former governor of New Jersey who built a political brand
  around unfiltered frank talk aimed at political opponents and constituents
  alike, is starting a think tank centered on something unexpected: Civility in
  politics.


  "Unfortunately our politics have gotten so ugly and divisive in the country
  that people are not having civilized conversations,"" Christie told NJ Advance
  Media, which broke the news."
