  The M.I.T. Media Lab, which has been embroiled in a scandal over accepting
  donations from the financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, had a
  deeper fund-raising relationship with Epstein than it has previously
  acknowledged, and it attempted to conceal the extent of its contacts with him.
  Dozens of pages of e-mails and other documents obtained by The New Yorker
  reveal that, although Epstein was listed as “disqualified” in M.I.T.’s
  official donor database, the Media Lab continued to accept gifts from him,
  consulted him about the use of the funds, and, by marking his contributions as
  anonymous, avoided disclosing their full extent, both publicly and within the
  university
