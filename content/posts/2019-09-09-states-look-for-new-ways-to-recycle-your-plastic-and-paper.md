excerpt: >-
  At least 10 states have passed or enacted legislation this year concerning
  recycling management. That is on top of another 200 bills introduced this year
  aimed at reducing single-use plastics. <br/>


  On the West Coast, where China’s policy shift hit particularly hard, officials
  from different states started meeting once a month to swap ideas and
  brainstorm strategies. </br>


  In California, the stakes are high. The state’s largest recycling center shut
  down earlier this month. And about two-thirds of California’s recyclables
  exported abroad went to China before the restrictions took place, according to
  CalRecycle, a part of the state’s Environmental Protection Agency that
  oversees waste management.
