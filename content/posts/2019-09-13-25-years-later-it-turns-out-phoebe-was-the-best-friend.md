  "So come Nov. 1, she’ll have a homecoming of sorts as the star of Apple’s “The
  Morning Show” — a big-budget drama set behind the scenes of a news show that
  looks a whole lot like “Today.” Aniston plays Alex Levy, a serious morning
  anchor whose personal life is complicated and professional life is more so,
  compounded by the sudden firing of her longtime co-host (played by Steve
  Carell) for sexual misconduct. For Apple, the show represents the shiniest
  bauble in its launch slate as it attempts to challenge the likes of Netflix
  with a streaming service of its own — and among the first shows to hang its
  premise on #MeToo."
