excerpt: >-
  Like a precursor to Dwight Schrute in “The Office,” Phoebe is a Trojan horse
  for dark humor on a network sitcom. Ross has his dinosaurs, Rachel has
  Bloomingdale’s, Monica is a neat freak, but Phoebe gets the grit of the world.
  Her mother killed herself in the family kitchen, her father abandoned their
  family, her stepfather went to prison, her twin sister rarely acknowledges
  her, her childhood toy was a barrel, she has at least one green-card marriage
  under her guitar strap, and she spent her Sweet Sixteen “being chased round a
  tire yard by an escaped mental patient who, in his own words, wanted to ‘kill
  me’ or whatever.”
