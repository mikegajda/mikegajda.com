excerpt: >-
  The Food and Drug Administration on Monday came out swinging at e-cigarette
  giant Juul over a variety of its unproven safety claims and startling
  marketing practices—most notably saying without evidence that its products are
  safer than smoking traditional cigarettes and giving presentations directly to
  kids in schools—in at least one alleged case, without teachers present or
  parental consent.
