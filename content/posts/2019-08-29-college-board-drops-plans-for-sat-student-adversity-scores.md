excerpt: >-
  The College Board is abandoning its plan to assign an adversity score to every
  student who takes the SAT college admissions test, after facing criticism from
  educators and parents.


  Instead, it will try to capture a student’s social and economic background in
  a broad array of data points. The new tactic is called Landscape and doesn’t
  combine the metrics into a single score.
