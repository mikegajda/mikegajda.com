  "Through sobs, Chevere says: ""Now I live in fear of another hurricane and we
  are not ready yet. We are not strong enough yet. Every time I hear about a
  hurricane, I feel pain and I lose my bearings.""


  Like Chevere, many others in Puerto Rico are still having a hard time coping
  with everyday life and understanding that what the island went through during
  Maria wasn't a small event. Across the island, more than 3 million people saw
  their communities devastated. Many lost their homes, their jobs, or families
  and friends."
