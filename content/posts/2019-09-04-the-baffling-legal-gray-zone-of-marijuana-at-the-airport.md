excerpt: >-
  And what may be legal locally isn’t legal federally, or in most destination
  states. It’s also illegal to transport marijuana across state lines, even from
  one state where it’s legal to another. So the federal Transportation Security
  Administration is in a tough spot. TSA is supposed to be looking for things
  that get you killed, not high.
