excerpt: >-
  "Yet despite being violently denied the freedom and justice promised to all,
  black Americans believed fervently in the American creed. Through centuries of
  black resistance and protest, we have helped the country live up to its
  founding ideals. And not only for ourselves — black rights struggles paved the
  way for every other rights struggle, including women’s and gay rights,
  immigrant and disability rights.


  Without the idealistic, strenuous and patriotic efforts of black Americans,
  our democracy today would most likely look very different — it might not be a
  democracy at all."
