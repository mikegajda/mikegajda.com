excerpt: >-
  For a century, we lived off the legacy of rapid innovation. It allowed our
  cities to grow exponentially and, therefore, the cost of our housing to
  decrease dramatically. But we’ve now pretty much burned through the benefits
  of these gains and there aren’t obvious technological saviors on the horizon.
  We must make do mostly with building up and densifying the urban areas we
  already have. As transportation goes, so go our cities.
