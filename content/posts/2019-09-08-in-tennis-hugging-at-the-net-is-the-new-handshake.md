excerpt: >-
  There was a time when the end of a tennis match required nothing more than a
  firm handshake and maybe a few kind words before both players gathered their
  belongings and left the court. The same held true for men and women. <br/>


  Today, hugging has become the new handshake, providing a level of intimacy
  that may make post-match meetings at the net as unrecognizable to past players
  as innovations like the Hawk-Eye ball tracking system and serving time limits.
