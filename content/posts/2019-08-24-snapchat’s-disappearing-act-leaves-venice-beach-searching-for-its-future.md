excerpt: >-
  The story of its rise was the toast of “Silicon Beach” in Los Angeles. The
  city is now the third largest tech hub on the West Coast after San Francisco
  and Seattle, with, according to a report by the real estate firm CBRE, nearly
  140,000 people working in tech. Along the way, Google, BuzzFeed, Vice and
  other tech and media companies planted flags in Venice. <br/>


  But none made a bigger imprint here than Snap, which championed an independent
  narrative by persistently fighting off acquisition attempts."
