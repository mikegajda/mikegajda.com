excerpt: >-
  I knew I had to write something about naked Germans when I happened upon a
  whole field of them sunbathing on my way to work. This was in the Tiergarten,
  Berlinâ€™s equivalent of Central Park, which runs adjacent to the office of
  Chancellor Angela Merkel, herself a longstanding sauna fan.
