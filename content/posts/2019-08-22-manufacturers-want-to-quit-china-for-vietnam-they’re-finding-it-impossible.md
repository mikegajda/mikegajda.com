excerpt: >-
  With the U.S. and China tangled in a nasty trade fight, this should be
  Vietnam’s time to shine. Instead, it is becoming increasingly clear that it
  will be years, if ever, before this Southeast Asian nation and other aspiring
  manufacturing destinations are ready to replace China as the world’s factory
  floor. <br/>


  The specialized supply chains that made China a production powerhouse for
  smartphones and aluminum ladders and vacuum cleaners and dining tables are
  nowhere near as developed in Vietnam. Factories with U.S.-focused safety
  certifications and capital-intensive machinery aren’t as easy to find. <br/>


  And Vietnam, with less than one-tenth China’s population, is already running
  into labor shortages as global manufacturers rush to set up shop here to avoid
  U.S. tariffs."
