excerpt: >-
  Dr. Arnold won for her work conducting the directed evolution of enzymes,
  proteins that catalyze chemical reactions. She first pioneered the
  bioengineering method, which works similar to the way dog breeders mate
  specific dogs to bring out desired traits, in the early 1990s, and has refined
  it since then.


  Her enzymes have been used to make biofuels, medicines and laundry detergent,
  among other things. In many processes, they have taken the place of toxic
  chemicals.
