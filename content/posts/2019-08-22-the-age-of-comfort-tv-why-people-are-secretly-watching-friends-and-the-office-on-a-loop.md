  Over the past month or so, I have been watching as much Modern Family as
  possible,” says Ciaran, 29, who works as a policy analyst in London. “I’ve
  seen them all loads of times, but I just don’t feel like watching anything
  else because I love the warmth and comfort that comes from the show. I think I
  started watching it again when I was going through a particularly bad time at
  work. I got addicted to the warmth, and then I got addicted to just feeling
  good about myself.
