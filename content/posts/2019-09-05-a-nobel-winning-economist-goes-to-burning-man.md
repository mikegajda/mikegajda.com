excerpt: >-
  It was an alluring sight for an economist who has talked of building cities
  from nothing. And Burning Man has been more and more on Mr. Romer’s mind
  lately, as world politics have made him gloomier. He is ill at ease behaving
  like a traditional academic. He’s not particularly interested in publishing
  papers. He doesn’t want to give speeches cheerleading his field. But he
  believes winning the Nobel has expanded his possibilities. More people will
  listen to what he has to say, if he can just decide where he wants to direct
  our attention.
