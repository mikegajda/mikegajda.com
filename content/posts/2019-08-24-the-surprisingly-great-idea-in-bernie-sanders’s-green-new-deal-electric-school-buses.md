excerpt: >-
  About 55 percent of America’s public school students get to school on buses —
  and 95 percent of those buses run on diesel. Researchers have measured
  pollutant levels on those buses, and they’re five to 10 times higher than
  pollution levels elsewhere. There’s preliminary evidence that retrofitting
  school buses to pollute less improves kids’ test scores, and that’s hardly
  surprising — the effects of air pollution on brain development are well
  established.
