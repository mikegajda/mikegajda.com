excerpt: >-
  A decade after fueling a crisis that nearly brought down the global financial
  system, Americaâ€™s banks are ruling it. They earned 62% of global
  investment-banking fees last year, up from 53% in 2011, according to
  Coalition, an industry data provider. Last year, U.S. banks took home $7 of
  every $10 in merger fees, $6 of every $10 in stock commissions, and $6 of
  every $10 paid to hold and move corporate cash.
