excerpt: >-
  China is on pace to have at least 150,000 5G wide-area base stations available
  for anyone to use, by the end of the year, more than any other country, said
  Bernstein’s Mr. Lane. Bernstein estimates South Korea will place second with
  75,000, while the U.S. will have 10,000 such sites by the year’s end. <br/>


  In the U.S., wireless carriers spend billions in Washington-run auctions for
  radio frequencies, or spectrum, for 5G. Then they spend billions more to lease
  real estate for cellular towers. Then they spend billions on top of that to
  build the actual towers and put hardware on them.
