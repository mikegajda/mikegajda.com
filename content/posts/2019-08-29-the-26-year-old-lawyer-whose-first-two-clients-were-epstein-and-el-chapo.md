excerpt: >-
  Three days before Epstein committed suicide, Colón Miró visited him at the MCC
  and served as a witness to his will. When Bloomberg reported on the will,
  including Colón Miró’s signature, people began sending her Facebook messages
  and leaving voicemails. She’d gotten similar messages throughout El Chapo’s
  trial. They always seemed to end up asking the same question: “How do you
  sleep at night?” <br/>


  “I sleep with a clear conscience,” she told me. “If you have a moral dilemma
  with that, then this profession is not for you. It’s easy to lose that human
  perspective in this profession. You think that detaching makes it easier to do
  your job, but it makes it harder for your client. You can’t ever lose that
  perspective, that empathy, that caring for them. I don’t ever want to lose it.
  I think that’s what distinguishes me.”
