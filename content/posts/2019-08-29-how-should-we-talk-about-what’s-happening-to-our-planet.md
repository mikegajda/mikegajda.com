  Luntz wants defter language. “The strongest advocates for a particular issue
  are often the worst communicators,” he says later by phone, because “they
  forget that the people they need to convince are not themselves or their
  friends.”

  how to talk and write about an issue that affects us all, maybe we can
  understand and fix it together.
