excerpt: >-
  "The film, which may represent Mr. Scorsese’s grandest statement yet on the
  intersection of organized crime and American politics, is expected to be a
  strong contender in the 2020 Oscar race. He took his $159 million movie, with
  Robert De Niro in the lead role, to Netflix after his home studio of recent
  years, Paramount Pictures, balked at the budget.  The full extent of the
  theatrical rollout remains up in the air. Where, exactly, moviegoers will be
  able to see “The Irishman” won’t be clear until the discussions between
  Netflix and select major theater chains end. They have been dragging on for
  months. The negotiations are just the latest chapter in the conflict between
  the film industry’s old guard and the tech-driven upstarts."
