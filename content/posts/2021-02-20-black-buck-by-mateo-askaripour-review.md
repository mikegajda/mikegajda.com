Considering I work at a B2B software company myself, albeit in the engineering department instead of the sales department, I could identify with some parts of the culture that Darren describes at tech companies.

I will note that my company purchased Black Buck for me and invited Mateo Askaripour to speak at a company Zoom. I think that showed a level of self-awareness.
