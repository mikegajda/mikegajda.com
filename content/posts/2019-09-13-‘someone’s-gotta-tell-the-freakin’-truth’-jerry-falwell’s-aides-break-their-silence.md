excerpt: >-
  In interviews over the past eight months, they depicted how Falwell and his
  wife, Becki, consolidated power at Liberty University and how Falwell presides
  over a culture of self-dealing, directing university resources into projects
  and real estate deals in which his friends and family have stood to make
  personal financial gains. Among the previously unreported revelations are
  Falwell’s decision to hire his son Trey’s company to manage a shopping center
  owned by the university, Falwell’s advocacy for loans given by the university
  to his friends, and Falwell’s awarding university contracts to businesses
  owned by his friends.
