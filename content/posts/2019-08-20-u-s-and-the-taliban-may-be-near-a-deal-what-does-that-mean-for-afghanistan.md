excerpt: >-
  "Nearly two decades into the war in Afghanistan, the U.S. suddenly appears to
  be nearing an agreement with the Taliban that could bring the remaining 14,000
  U.S. troops home.


  That's causing unease inside the Afghan government, which has been left on the
  sidelines as the U.S. and the Taliban have held multiple rounds of talks this
  year in the Gulf nation of Qatar. The latest round wrapped up last week
  without a deal, but with signs of progress."
