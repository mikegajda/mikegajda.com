excerpt: >-
  Employees are now barred from making statements that "insult, demean, or
  humiliate" other employees, the company's extended workforce, business
  partners or others. The rules also discourage Google employees from engaging
  in a "raging debate over politics or the latest news story" and to avoid
  conversations that are generally disruptive.
