  Facebook’s own analysis found the social-media giant wasn’t able to uncover
  and stamp out suspicious behavior or misinformation on a large scale after the
  assassination of Brazilian politician Marielle Franco in March 2018, according
  to documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. Facebook still relied on
  third parties, including the media, to flag issues bearing on that year’s
  October election because it hadn’t yet developed tools for “proactive
  detection” of certain problems, the documents show.
