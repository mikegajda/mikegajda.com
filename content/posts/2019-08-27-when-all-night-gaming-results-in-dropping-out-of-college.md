excerpt: >-
  Statistics on the number of college students who drop out due to gaming are
  hard to come by because colleges rarely conduct exit interviews when students
  leave. But even a decade and a half ago, the Pew Research Center found that
  nearly half of college gamers said gaming keeps them from studying. And it
  isn’t just games—experts say students also use their phones as a salve when
  they feel like withdrawing from the real world.
