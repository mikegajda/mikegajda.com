excerpt: >-
  "Today, I was nearly killed no less than three times while biking from my
  apartment in Brooklyn to my office in Lower Manhattan. But don’t worry! This
  is pretty normal for America’s largest city, where a staggering 19 cyclists
  have been killed in just 2019 alone.


  So you can imagine my bafflement when I finally sat down at my desk, sweaty
  and stressed out from my close brushes with death, and the first thing I see
  when opening up Twitter was this video of a newly finished bike parking garage
  in the Dutch city of Utrecht"
