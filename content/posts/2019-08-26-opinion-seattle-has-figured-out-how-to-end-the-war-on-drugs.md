  "This model is becoming the consensus preference among public health experts
  in the U.S. and abroad. Still, it shocks many Americans to see no criminal
  penalty for using drugs illegally, so it takes courage and vision to adopt
  this approach: a partial retreat in the war on drugs coupled with a stepped-up
  campaign against addiction. <br/>


  The war on drugs has been one of Americaâ€™s most grievous mistakes, resulting
  in as many citizens with arrest records as with college diplomas. At last
  count, an American was arrested for drug possession every 25 seconds, yet the
  mass incarceration this leads to has not turned the tide on narcotics."
