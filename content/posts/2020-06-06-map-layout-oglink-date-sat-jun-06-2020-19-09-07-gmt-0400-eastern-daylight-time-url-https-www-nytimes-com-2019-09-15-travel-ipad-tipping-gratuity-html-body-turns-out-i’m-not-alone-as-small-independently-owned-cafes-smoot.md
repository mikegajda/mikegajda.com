As small, independently owned cafes, smoothie bars and fast-casualrestaurantsin the United States have adopted customer-facing touch-screen payment systems in recent years — and as credit cards have replaced cash for even the smallest purchases — Americans and (heaven help them) foreign visitors have been confronted with a new kind of tipping.
