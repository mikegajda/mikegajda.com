excerpt: >-
  In the middle of the documentary Jawline, 16-year-old nano-celebrity Austyn
  Tester organizes a fan meetup in a mall food court. A gaggle of teen and tween
  girls show up, and he soaks up their rapturous affection, offering
  compliments, hugs, and photos. Then, the group walks the mall together in a
  strange parody of a first date: Austyn in front, the girls trailing behind
  him, phone cameras aloft.
