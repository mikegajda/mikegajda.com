  Though it’s difficult to know for certain, if the size of its sales force, the
  quantity of its shell companies, and the strength of its advertising are any
  indication, it appears that Yuancheng has sold more of the NPP and 4-ANPP used
  illicitly than any other company. It has done so not through secret
  underground networks or terrorist cells, but over the internet, using an army
  of young, perky sales representatives. Posting cheeky job advertisements on
  the internet and offering employees free cellphones, it’s a poison factory
  operating in plain sight
