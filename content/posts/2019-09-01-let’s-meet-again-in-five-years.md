excerpt: >-
  What is true is how the story has helped sustain our relationship through
  times of trouble. I would have hated to end the story with, “Unfortunately, it
  didn’t work out.” With a story like that, of course we had to stay together. A
  romantic past, we’ve discovered, can help keep you belted in place until you
  find equilibrium.
