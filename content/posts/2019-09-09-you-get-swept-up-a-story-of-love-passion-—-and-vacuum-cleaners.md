  "When they first got together in 2013, Pedrola was a vacuum novice. But that
  part of Gasko has rubbed off on him, and now Pedrola takes pride in knowing
  Electroluxes and Hoovers from Dirt Devils and Kirbys on the tours he gives at
  the museum.


  "The night you came over for our very first date, I think we probably talked
  for four or five hours about the different designs of vacuums," Gasko says. "I
  would eventually start showing you the old ones that were in the garage.
  That's when you thought I was crazy."
