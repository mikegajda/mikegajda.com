  The feeling that “free shipping” is a lie comes up often too. Amazon Prime,
  after all, is a paid yearly subscription. Etsy is “asking their sellers to be
  dishonest and roll the shipping costs into the total price, which of course
  means it’s not ‘free’ at all,” says Owen Johnston, who makes about 90 percent
  of his income selling replica skulls on Etsy but plans to look for a different
  platform.
