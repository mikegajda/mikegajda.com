excerpt: >-
  The Holosphere is Prydz’s latest Eric Prydz In Concert (EPIC) show, a
  limited-run multi-sensory experience he and his team have been constantly
  developing for almost a decade. The show has grown dramatically over the
  years, and versions have included hundreds of laser beams, digital screens
  larger than a jumbo jet, and colossal holographic effects. They’re
  breathtaking, but not practical, and production for The Holosphere is so large
  Tomorrowland had to redesign its grounds in order to accommodate it.
