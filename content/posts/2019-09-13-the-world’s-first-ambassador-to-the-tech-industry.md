excerpt: >-
  "In 2017, Denmark became the first nation to formally create a diplomatic post
  to represent its interests before companies such as Facebook and Google. After
  Denmark determined that tech behemoths now have as much power as many
  governments — if not more — Mr. Klynge was sent to Silicon Valley. <br/>


  “What has the biggest impact on daily society? A country in southern Europe,
  or in Southeast Asia, or Latin America, or would it be the big technology
  platforms?” Mr. Klynge said in an interview last month at a cafe in central
  Copenhagen during an annual meeting of Denmark’s diplomatic corps. “Our
  values, our institutions, democracy, human rights, in my view, are being
  challenged right now because of the emergence of new technologies.”"
