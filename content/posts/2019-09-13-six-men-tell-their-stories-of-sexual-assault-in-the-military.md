excerpt: >-
  Elected officials and Pentagon leaders have tended to focus on the thousands
  of women who have been preyed upon while in uniform. But over the years, more
  of the victims have been men. On average, about 10,000 men are sexually
  assaulted in the American military each year, according to Pentagon
  statistics. Overwhelmingly, the victims are young and low-ranking. Many
  struggle afterward, are kicked out of the military and have trouble finding
  their footing in civilian life.
