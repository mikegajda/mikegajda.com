excerpt: >-
  I wasn’t really supposed to be setting the forest on fire. That was the job of
  the United States Forest Service crew whose work I was there to observe. Their
  task was to carry out a prescribed burn—a carefully controlled, low-intensity
  fire that clears duff and deadwood, reducing the risk of a catastrophic
  wildfire. But the crew were temporarily occupied by what they called “a
  slop-over event”: a rogue ember had leaped across a trail that acted as a
  firebreak at one edge of the burn, sparking a half-acre blaze so hot that
  standing within a few feet of it made my chest hurt. While the crew used
  chainsaws and hoes to create a new firebreak, it fell to me to insure that no
  part of the line got ahead of the rest. If flames are allowed to break ranks
  and surge forward, they can whirl around and start running with the wind,
  burning more intensely and smokily than the prescription allows.

This reminds me of a project I did in college on prescribed burns. It's good to see them being implemented to help fight the fires that have plagued California.
