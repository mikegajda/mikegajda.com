  The organization, which championed tobacco interests during the 1980s and
  1990s in Europe and the United States, has more recently expanded its
  activities in Asia and Latin America, regions that provide a growing share of
  food company profits. It has been especially active in China, India and
  Brazil, the world’s first, second and sixth most populous nations.


  In China, the institute shares both staff and office space with the agency
  responsible for combating the country’s epidemic of obesity-related illness.
  In Brazil, ILSI representatives occupy seats on a number of food and nutrition
  panels that were previously reserved for university researchers.
