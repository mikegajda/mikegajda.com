> You already have a closet, but now Samsung wants you to have another. This
week, it announced the AirDresser, a freestanding closet-within-a-closet that
cleans and straightens your clothes after you hang them up and walk away.
Similar to the LG Styler and the lower-end, now discontinued Whirlpool Swash
home dry cleaning appliances, the idea is you hang your shirts, dress pants,
sweaters, and delicates inside these devices, which then use a heating or
steaming process to clean them.
