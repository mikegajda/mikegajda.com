  "The research is aimed at finding new ways to prevent disorders caused by
  genetic mutations that are passed down from men — including some forms of male
  infertility. The team is starting with a gene that can increase the risk for
  breast, ovarian, prostate and other cancers.


  The experiments are just starting and have not yet been successful. But the
  research raises many of the same hopes — and fears — as editing the DNA of
  human embryos. Nevertheless, the researchers defend the work."
