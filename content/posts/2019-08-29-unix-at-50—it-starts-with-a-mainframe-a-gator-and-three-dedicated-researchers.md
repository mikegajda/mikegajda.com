excerpt: >-
  The computer science department pitched lab management on the purchase of a
  DEC PDP-11 for document production purposes, and Max Mathews offered to pay
  for the machine out of the acoustics department budget. Finally, management
  gave in and purchased a computer for the Unix team to play with. Eventually,
  word leaked out about this operating system, and businesses and institutions
  with PDP-11s began contacting Bell Labs about their new operating system. The
  Labs made it available for free—requesting only the cost of postage and media
  from anyone who wanted a copy.


  The rest has quite literally made tech history. By the late 1970s, a copy of
  the operating system found its way out to the University of California at
  Berkeley, and in the early 1980s, programmers there adapted it to run on PCs.
  Their version of Unix, the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD), was picked up
  by developers at NeXT, the company Steve Jobs founded after leaving Apple in
  1985. When Apple purchased NeXT in 1996, BSD became the starting point for OS
  X and iOS.
