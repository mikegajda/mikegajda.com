excerpt: >-
  Losing your native tongue unmoors you not only from your own early life but
  from the entire culture that shaped you. You lose access to the books, films,
  stories, and songs that articulate the values and norms that you’ve absorbed.
  You lose the embrace of an entire community or nation for whom your family’s
  odd quirks are not quirks all. You lose your context
