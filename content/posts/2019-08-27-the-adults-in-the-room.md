excerpt: >-
  Gawker Media is dead, of course. But it’s not dead because it failed; it’s
  dead because it was murdered by a vindictive billionaire and there existed no
  legal infrastructure to protect it. When Gawker was murdered in a terrifying
  blow to freedom of the press, a shocking number of other journalists said the
  site deserved it: They should have had more decorum, should have been less
  rude, should have placated the right people instead of making fun of them.
  What those journalists didn’t say, and what they still don’t say, was that
  Gawker made journalism better through inspiring new publications and through
  pushing the legacy ones to be more interesting
