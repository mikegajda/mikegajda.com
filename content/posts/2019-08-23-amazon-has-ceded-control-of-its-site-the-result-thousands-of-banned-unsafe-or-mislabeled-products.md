  "Many of the millions of people who shop on Amazon.com see it as if it were an
  American big-box store, a retailer with goods deemed safe enough for
  customers.

  <br/>

  In practice, Amazon has increasingly evolved like a flea market. It exercises
  limited oversight over items listed by millions of third-party sellers, many
  of them anonymous, many in China, some offering scant information.

  <br/>

  A Wall Street Journal investigation found 4,152 items for sale on Amazon.com
  Inc. ’s site that have been declared unsafe by federal agencies, are
  deceptively labeled or are banned by federal regulators—items that big-box
  retailers’ policies would bar from their shelves. Among those items, at least
  2,000 listings for toys and medications lacked warnings about health risks to
  children."
