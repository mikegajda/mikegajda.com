excerpt: >-
  Students from mainland China make up one-third of all international students
  in the U.S. and outnumber those from the second and third most represented
  countries (India and South Korea) combined. For the most part, these students
  don’t watch U.S. election returns on CNN or get word of the latest viral
  moment via Twitter. They get such news on their phones, often from College
  Daily, in a stream of memes and Internet-speak
