excerpt: >-
  If the term “working homeless” has not yet entered our national vocabulary,
  there is reason to expect that it soon will. Hidden within the world of
  homelessness has always been a subset of individuals, usually single parents,
  with jobs; what’s different now is the sheer extent of this phenomenon. For a
  widening swath of the nearly seven million American workers living below the
  poverty line, a combination of skyrocketing rents, stagnant wages, and a lack
  of tenant protections has proved all but insurmountable.
