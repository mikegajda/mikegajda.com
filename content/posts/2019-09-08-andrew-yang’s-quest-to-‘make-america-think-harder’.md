excerpt: >-
  Meet Andrew Yang supporters and they often have a confession to make: When
  they first heard about Mr. Yang, they thought his plan to give every American
  adult $1,000 a month was a little crazy. But then, they will inevitably tell
  you, they heard him explain it, and it all started making sense. <br/>


  “He was a meme — his campaign was a joke,” said Ben Longchamp, 20, a college
  student from Atkinson, N.H., who first saw Mr. Yang speak in May, at a
  restaurant in Portsmouth. “I’ve seen 14 candidates at this point, and what I
  like about him is he has this one policy proposal and he has the data to back
  it up.”
