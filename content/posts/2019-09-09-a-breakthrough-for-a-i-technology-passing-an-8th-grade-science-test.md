excerpt: >-
  Researchers at the Allen Institute started work on Aristo — they wanted to
  build a “digital Aristotle” — in 2013, just after the lab was founded by the
  Seattle billionaire and Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. They saw standardized
  science tests as a more meaningful alternative to typical A.I. benchmarks,
  which relied on games like chess and backgammon or tasks created solely for
  machines.


  A science test isn’t something that can be mastered just by learning rules. It
  requires making connections using logic. An increase in forest fires, for
  example, could kill squirrels or decrease the food supply needed for them to
  thrive and reproduce.
